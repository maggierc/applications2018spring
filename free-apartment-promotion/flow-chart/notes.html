    <h1>Design the Experience.</h1>
    <h3>Resources:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://burgerbff.com/" target="_blank">Burger BFF</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Additional Guidelines:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>this is a microsite</li>
      <li>define the happy path (the way you hope the user to go)</li>
      <li>assume that EZ has a cyclical email process, big push into spring/summer and then emails die off</li>
      <li>EZ Properties has moderate properties, similar to loop style apartments</li>
      <li>point of promotion is to gather emails: anyone who loses becomes a new contact for EZ</li>
      <li>understood that entering the sweepstakes means joining the newsletter (may need explicit wording)</li>
      <li><strong>how will the website behave depending on what i do as a user? (NOT LINEAR)</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>i.e. if they don't put in a valid email, you should tell them</li>
        <li>when user puts in email, they should move on to a screen that confirms it</li>
        <ul>
          <li>say thanks!</li>
        </ul>
        <li>choices offered up: back up, check out fine print, give options to get extra info to ease hesitations</li>
        <li>what happens if they've already signed up?</li>
        <ul>
          <li>sorry, you've already entered thAnkS aNYwaY</li>
        </ul>
        <li>if you made a mistake in the form, it should STAY on the form instead of just moving on</li>
        <li>have spots that suggest user to check out properties ("start thinking about where you want to live without rent!")</li>
        <li>starting with about / immediate sign up</li>
      </ul>
      <li>show map of properties at some point?</li>
      <li><strong>specific dates the user should know about</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li>IDEA: show calendar of how far away user is from sweepstakes? countdown timer?</li>
        <li>what does site look like before?</li>
        <li>during?</li>
        <li>after submission but before announcement?</li>
        <ul>
          <li>i.e. can't see winner announcement page before anyone wins</li>
        </ul>
        <li>for announcement?</li>
        <li>after everythings over?</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>Personas for project:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>wash u students who are looking for an apartment already</li>
      <li>wash u students who are considering it but haven't searched</li>
    </ul>

    <p>has to convince students that EZ Properties is a good company to do business with</p>

    <h3>Getting into the project:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>how do people interact with devices</li>
      <li>look up other sweepstakes/promotions</li>
      <li>look up microsites</li>
      <li>why would people avoid promotions?</li>
      <li>look at advertising campaigns (spotify?)</li>
      <li>is submitting an email a good thing?</li>
      <li>how do we make EZ Properties look good?</li>
      <li>eligibility can be confirmed AFTER win, so you only really need to have people submit ways to contact them</li>
      <li>how much information do users need to engage fully? how little information do they need?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>balance competing needs of user and company</p>
    <ul>
      <li>user wants to give away as little information as possible to win; company wants to gain as much information as possible in order to continue contacting students</li>
    </ul>
    <p>extending past visual design, important to understand what users want and how to COMMUNICATE to them</p>
