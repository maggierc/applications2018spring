<!-- Select a real website for purchasing a bicycle, then 'be' the persona your team defined as you go through the purchasing process once again. Break the process down into a series of small, discrete objectives, following the User Story pattern: "As a < type of user >, I want < some goal > so that < some reason >." Write the these objectives down in an HTML document, provide context and style sufficient to let somebody else understand what you've documented, and post it. -->

      <!-- <h2>Sukari's Story:</h2>

      <p>"As a leisure rider, I’m looking for a bike that can take me around the city. I don’t know much about bikes but am looking for something affordable because I don’t anticipate using it daily. It needs to be comfortable and easy to ride. I anticipate going on bike rides and enjoying the scenery. As a freelance designer I often seek inspiration from nature and would like to use biking as a way to get out of the house and regroup during the course of projects."</p>

      <h2>Final(?)</h2>

      <p>"As a tourist/leisure rider, I want a comfortable, easy-to-control, affordable bike so that I can explore the outdoors and have fun."</p>
